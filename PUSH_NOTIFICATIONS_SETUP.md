# üîî Complete Push Notifications Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ Current Status
Your iOS app code is fully configured for push notifications. Here's what's implemented:

- ‚úÖ **Entitlements configured** (development mode)
- ‚úÖ **Firebase Cloud Messaging integrated**
- ‚úÖ **Permission request flow implemented**
- ‚úÖ **FCM token management**
- ‚úÖ **Notification handling (foreground/background)**
- ‚úÖ **Cloud Functions for sending notifications**

## üö® CRITICAL: Firebase Console Setup Required

### Step 1: Configure APNs in Firebase Console

**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS IS MANDATORY - Your push notifications will NOT work without this step!**

1. **Get your Apple Developer Team ID:**
   - Go to [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/account/)
   - Note your **Team ID** (top right corner)

2. **Create APNs Authentication Key:**
   - In Apple Developer Console: **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles** ‚Üí **Keys**
   - Click **"+"** to create new key
   - Name: "APNs Key for RefractiveExchange"
   - Enable: **Apple Push Notifications service (APNs)**
   - Click **Register** ‚Üí **Download** the `.p8` file
   - **IMPORTANT:** Note the **Key ID** shown after creation

3. **Upload to Firebase:**
   - Open [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Select your project: **refractiveexchange**
   - Go to **‚öôÔ∏è Project Settings** ‚Üí **Cloud Messaging** tab
   - Under **"APNs authentication key"**, click **Upload**
   - Upload your `.p8` file
   - Enter your **Key ID** and **Team ID**
   - Click **Upload**

### Step 2: Xcode Project Settings

**In Xcode (MUST BE DONE):**

1. **Select your app target** ‚Üí **Signing & Capabilities**
2. **Add Capability**: **Push Notifications**
3. **Add Capability**: **Background Modes**
   - Enable: **Remote notifications**

### Step 3: Deploy Cloud Functions (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI if you haven't
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Navigate to functions directory
cd /Users/gurpalvirdi/RefractiveExchange/firebase-functions

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Deploy functions
firebase deploy --only functions
```

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

### Method 1: Firebase Console Test (Easiest)

1. **Build and run your app on a PHYSICAL DEVICE**
2. **Accept notification permission** when prompted
3. **Check Xcode console** for FCM token (starts with something like "cL2v8...")
4. **In Firebase Console:**
   - Go to **Cloud Messaging**
   - Click **"Send your first message"**
   - Enter title/body
   - Click **"Test on device"**
   - Paste your FCM token
   - Click **Test**

### Method 2: In-App Test (After Cloud Functions deployed)

Your app will automatically send push notifications when:
- Someone likes your post
- Someone comments on your post
- Someone sends you a direct message
- Your post reaches milestone likes (5, 10, 25, etc.)

## üì± What Users Will Experience

Your users will receive notifications exactly like Instagram DMs or Reddit replies:

- **Lock Screen**: Full notification with title and message
- **Banner**: Top-of-screen notification while using phone
- **Badge**: Red number on app icon
- **Sound**: Default notification sound
- **Tap to Navigate**: Automatically opens relevant post/conversation

## üöÄ Before Submitting to Apple

### Change to Production Mode:

1. **Update entitlements** for production:
   ```xml
   <key>aps-environment</key>
   <string>production</string>
   ```

2. **Upload Production APNs Certificate to Firebase:**
   - Create a new APNs key in Apple Developer Console
   - Upload to Firebase (same process as above)

### Verify Everything Works:

- [ ] APNs key uploaded to Firebase ‚úÖ
- [ ] Push Notifications capability added in Xcode ‚úÖ
- [ ] Background Modes enabled ‚úÖ
- [ ] App requests permission on launch ‚úÖ
- [ ] FCM token generated and saved ‚úÖ
- [ ] Test notification received ‚úÖ

## üîß Troubleshooting

**No FCM Token Generated:**
- Check Apple Developer account has push notifications enabled
- Verify APNs key is uploaded to Firebase
- Make sure you're testing on physical device

**Permission Denied:**
- Go to iPhone Settings ‚Üí RefractiveExchange ‚Üí Notifications
- Enable notifications manually

**Notifications Not Received:**
- Check if Firebase Cloud Functions are deployed
- Verify APNs key is correctly uploaded
- Ensure app is signed with correct team ID

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Xcode console for error messages
2. Verify Firebase Console shows your APNs key as "Active"
3. Test with Firebase Console first before testing app features

---

**üéâ Once APNs is configured in Firebase Console, your app will send notifications just like Instagram and Reddit!**
